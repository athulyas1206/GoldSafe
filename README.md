# Jewellery Image Similarity & Pledge Identification System
This project is an AI-based image similarity system for gold jewellery items 
such as rings, bangles, earrings, and necklaces.

Users can upload an image of a jewellery item and select its category.
The system retrieves the most visually similar jewellery items from the dataset.
This can be used in gold pledge / valuation / verification scenarios.
